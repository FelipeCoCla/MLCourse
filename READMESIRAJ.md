Homeworks Assingments from machinelearningcourse.io
Dont like the improvised videos.

I would like to see more value than your youtube channel, please look Kiril Emerenko's courses or lazy programmer inc on udemy
for example Machine learning A-Z tm, from Kiril Emerenko, 20 usd and a hell of a complete course, clean, tidy and not improvised

just some feedback, huge fan tho.
